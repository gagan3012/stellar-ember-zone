      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        I'm an AI Research Scientist working on improving Large Language Models through better understanding of their limitations and capabilities. My research focuses on temporal reasoning in LLMs, multilingual AI systems, and developing robust evaluation frameworks.

        My work spans multiple domains including Arabic NLP, multimodal AI, and building efficient systems for real-world applications in healthcare and finance.

        I'm passionate about making AI systems more interpretable, reliable, and accessible across languages and cultures.

        Feel free to reach out to collaborate! 😃
